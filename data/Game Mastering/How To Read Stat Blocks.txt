This section presents an example of a creature stat block that might be found in a Starfinder product. Below is a description of each line in that stat block. Note that this example isnâ€™t meant to be used as written; it is merely a way to show the different aspects of a stat block. Any abilities that differ from the rules for characters are either universal creature abilities (see the Starfinder Alien Archive) or explained at the end of the stat block.
